##1. Description
Our project SmartSet is a forum intended for students in Information Technology. You can create your own profile, can ask questions by posting a topic on the forum in a certain category, can answer other colleagues' questions, can rate them both topics and comments, can filter (search) the topics from a certain category etc. <br />
The website that we made represents Educational Forum. It allows the users to sign in or to create a new account. On the Homeage a list of all recently created topics is displayed. On this page, besides the topic titles, there are few other information like number of comments, likes and date the topic has been created. Once the user signs in with their email and password, it is possible for the user to see the other users, to ask a question on the forum, to comment, to like other posts and other comments, to sign out, to edit their profile etc. If the option Notifications is chosen in the Settings, then a new page with all the recent notifications is displayed. Here the user can see who has liked his topics, his comments, or most important, who has replied on their topic. They can also click on the topic link in the notification itself and then are lead to the topic link. If they comment, the other user, whose comment or topic it is, will be notified immediately and will be able to see the news in their own Notification page. Furthermore, if the user clicks Edit profile, they are able to change the information entered during registration. If the user currently is not logged in and is trying to comment, rate or post a topic, they will be lead to the Login page, and after successful login will be switched  back to the requested page. Website can be closed anytime.
##2. Guide
###2.1 Login and Registration
After opening our website, a list of topics can be noticed on the screen. This is visible for any user, either anonymous or logged in user. In order to do any kind of activity on the forum (comment, post, like) you must register first and then if already have an account, log in. It can be done by clicking the *Login* button in the upper right corner. 
On the home page besides the topics list there are also buttons for register and Login in the corner. The button *Register* leads to a form for creating new user profile where the user can enter data. All the fields are required. These are just the basic information, but later in Edit profile user can add additional information (bio, profile picture...). By clicking Register a confirmation e-mail with link for activating profile is sent to the user in order to approve that the e-mail entered belongs to the user.
If the user has forgotten his password and he can't log in, there's an option Forgot password in the Login page. After clicking that link the user is redirected to the *Forgot password* page, where he enters his email and a confirmation code is generated and send to the user's email together with the link to the *Reset password* page. On that page he can change the password, only if he enters the sent confirmation code.
###2.2 Settings
After login in the right upper corner the user can see his avatar. If the avatar is clicked a submenu opens, in which the user can see Notifications (recent activity, who has replied or rated their topics), view their profile and invite their friends. By inviting friends, user enters friend's e-mail and they receive an invitation link to join our *Smart Set* forum. Also, option for logging out is here. **Terms and conditions** on the site can be found below the content at any page.
###2.3 Profile
All the information about the user is here, as well as the needed information for the current user. Anytime user is able to change their information, upload a photo, write short biography of themselves etc. 
By clicking *Save changes* the changes that were made are saved and updated to the database.
###2.4 Forum
The forum itself is actually a list of all the topics organized by **categories**. There are some predefined categories. Users can follow categories and they get a notification when another user posts a topic in their list of followed categories. There are also three tabs. Each of them sorts the topics in a different way, according to the date they had been posted, how many replies they have, or according to the rating. When a topic title is clicked, then its content is shown on another page. Topics can be rated, and comments can be writen as a reply to them, which is the main point of the forum - students to help eachother. By clicking on a certain category, there is a list of all the topics that belong to it, and also is visible for each user how many followers does that category have.
There is also **Search** option in order to find a topic easier.
Any user is able to ask a question about the category he is interested in. Any logged in user is able to comment for a solution on the problem. The owner of the post is notified for this activity. There is an option to *report* a topic or comment, which then goes in an administrator's list, where they are going to decide whether to delete it or not.
